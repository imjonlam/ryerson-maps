The context of this project is a campus similar to Ryerson University. When the user has a class, club meeting or event, they show up at a certain place and need to find how to
get to the actual location. The user does not know where the location of their destination is, and they might not even know their exact location at that time. Nonetheless, the user
should be able to inform the app where they are at this moment, through a combination of typing, use of QR codes (placed around key points on campus) through the mobile
phone camera, the GPS information from their mobile phone, and the location of the desired destination. The user can use the app while connected to the internet or offline (with
some real-time features disabled), save preferences (locations and routes) and be able to alter their route. Additional features of the app include being able to sync with their
Google Calendar or add scheduled events, receive reported security alerts on campus (with the suggested route altered accordingly), and see how crowded a location is with
heatmaps.
